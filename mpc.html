    <h2>About the Course</h2>
 <a href="mpc1.html" onclick="history.back();" class="back-button">&#8592;</a>
    <p>
      MPC utilizes the model of a system to predict its future behavior, and it solves an online optimization algorithm to select the best control action that drives the predicted output to the reference. It can control multi-input multi-output systems that might have interactions between inputs and outputs.
    </p>
